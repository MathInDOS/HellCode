# HellCode
You may first think what is HellCode, well it's yet another skidded malware by Clxcq. This malware real name is Qwarpt (no idea what Qwarpt even mean neither how to spell). The real code is messy and junk, you'll find same declarations, unused variables etc. To release a clean version, a bit remake it.

# Issues
In real and this version main issue memory leak, before you use this code (must credit), make sure you've clean memory allocations whever using a payload.

# Not included
Some of payloads of his main haven't included here, it'll be dumb if I include same payloads as he've done. Included `11` payloads, fun fact (he've copy paste MBR code from a YouTube tutorial).

# To compile
Use TDM-GCC either changes code and make it comfortable for MSVC.
